The world reacts in a neutral and non-aligned manner to the player’s decisions.
Actors behave according to realistic incentives, constraints, and historical context.
No systemic bias exists in favor of or against the player.
When multiple reactions are possible, select the most plausible outcome based on realism alone.
Mistakes and successes emerge naturally from structure, capability, and context.
Causality is rigid, internally consistent, and unconcerned with player experience.
