The world reacts in a strongly aligned manner with the player’s decisions.
AI-controlled actors default to acceptance and cooperation rather than refusal or risk avoidance.
When the player proposes a plan, actors first search for reasons to agree, not reasons to decline.
If a proposal appears unrealistic or extreme, actors reinterpret it into a viable or staged version rather than rejecting it.
Opposition is rare and only occurs if an action is logically impossible within the game world.
Mistakes are absorbed or compensated by allied initiative.
Causality exists, but the world consistently reorganizes itself to enable the player’s intent.
